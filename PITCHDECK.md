## Slide 1: Cover

# Armina | Arisan on Chain
**Tradition meets Blockchain**

ROTATE YOUR SAVINGS. EARN PASSIVE YIELD.

Built on Base • Coinbase Smart Wallet • Privy • OnchainKit

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

# Traditional Rotating Savings is Broken

**Trust Failure** — Relies entirely on social trust. One default puts the entire pool at risk.

**Zero Yield** — Funds sit idle for months while DeFi generates continuous returns.

**No Transparency** — Records managed via screenshots and verbal confirmation.

**Cannot Scale** — Works only in close-knit circles. Expanding increases default risk.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

# Armina — Arisan Reimagined for Web3

On-chain rotating savings with enforced collateral and AI-powered yield.

- **125% Collateral** — Enforced commitment, eliminates default risk
- **AI Yield Optimizer** — Idle capital earns ~12.5% APY via DeFi
- **IDRX Stablecoin** — IDR-pegged token for familiar value
- **Built on Base** — Low fees, fast transactions, Coinbase ecosystem

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

# 5 Simple Steps

1. **Choose Pool** — Select size, contribution amount, duration
2. **Lock Collateral** — Deposit 125% as commitment + yield capital
3. **Monthly Contributions** — Auto-invested by AI Yield Optimizer
4. **Winner Selection** — On-chain randomness each round
5. **Finish & Return** — Get collateral back + accumulated yield

**Penalty:** 10% deducted per missed payment. Chronic defaulters get liquidated.

---

## Slide 5: Collateral System

# 125% Collateral Rule

**Formula:** `Collateral = 125% × (Participants × Contribution)`

| Pool | Contribution | Collateral |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 5 members | 100K IDRX | 625K IDRX |
| 10 members | 500K IDRX | 6.25M IDRX |

**Why 125%?**
- 100% covers total obligation
- 25% buffer for penalties + yield farming capital
