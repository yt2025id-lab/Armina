# Armina Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** ✅ Core Features Implemented
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Armina is a decentralized arisan (ROSCA) platform with AI-optimized yield generation. Users join pools, make monthly contributions, and earn yield on their collateral while participating in fair, randomized pot distributions.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Smart Contract (Solidity)
**File:** `contracts/ArminaPool.sol`

**Core Functions Implemented:**
- ✅ `createPool(monthlyAmount, poolSize)` - Create new pools with sizes 5, 10, 15, or 20
- ✅ `joinPool(poolId)` - Join pool with collateral + first payment
- ✅ `processMonthlyPayment(month)` - Wallet-based payments with collateral backup
- ✅ `batchProcessPayments(month)` - Admin function for processing all participants
- ✅ `requestWinnerDraw()` - Chainlink VRF integration for random selection
- ✅ `fulfillRandomWords()` - VRF callback for winner distribution
- ✅ `claimFinalSettlement()` - End-of-pool payout calculation
- ✅ View functions for pool/participant details, payment history, projected payouts

**Key Features:**
- Collateral = Pot Size (poolSize × monthlyAmount)
- Automatic penalty system (10% per missed payment)
- Wallet-first payment with collateral fallback
- Yield tracking for both collateral and pot
- Complete settlement calculations

## 📋 Business Logic Summary

### Payment Mechanism
```
Join Payment = Collateral (poolSize × monthlyAmount) + First Month Payment

Monthly Payments (Months 2-N):
1. Try to deduct from wallet
2. If wallet insufficient → deduct from collateral + 10% penalty
3. Track all payments and penalties
```

### Collateral Calculation by Pool Size
| Pool Size | Monthly Amount | Collateral Required |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 5 people  | 500K IDRX     | 2,500K IDRX (5×)   |
| 10 people | 500K IDRX     | 5,000K IDRX (10×)  |
| 15 people | 500K IDRX     | 7,500K IDRX (15×)  |
| 20 people | 500K IDRX     | 10,000K IDRX (20×) |

### Final Settlement Formula
```solidity
Final Payout = Collateral + Collateral Yield - Missed Payments - Penalties

Where:
- Collateral = Original deposit
- Collateral Yield = (Collateral × APY × Months) / (100 × 12)
- Missed Payments = Sum of payments taken from collateral
- Penalties = 10% × Missed Payments
```

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Perfect Attendance (10-person pool, 500K/month)**
```
Spent:
- Wallet payments: 5,000K (10 months)
- Collateral deposited: 5,000K
Total: 10,000K

Received:
- Collateral: 5,000K
- Yield (8% APY): 333K
Total: 5,333K

Net: +333K profit (yield only)
```

**Scenario 2: Perfect + Win Month 5**
```
Spent: 10,000K

Received:
- Collateral + Yield: 5,333K
- Pot (Month 5): 5,000K
- Pot Yield: 167K
Total: 10,500K

Net: +500K profit
```

**Scenario 3: Won Month 1 & Stopped Paying (Anti-Kabur Test)**
```
Spent: 5,500K (collateral + month 1)

Received:
- Pot + Pot Yield: 5,035K
- Collateral return: 383K (after 9 missed payments + penalties)
Total: 5,418K

Net: -82K LOSS ✅ (Anti-kabur works!)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Smart Contract
- ✅ ReentrancyGuard on all state-changing functions
- ✅ Access control with Ownable
- ✅ Checks-effects-interactions pattern
- ✅ SafeERC20 for token transfers
- ⚠️ **TODO:** External audit required before mainnet

### Frontend
- ✅ Client-side validation for all inputs
- ✅ Wallet connection security (Privy)
- ✅ Transaction confirmation UI
- ⚠️ **TODO:** Rate limiting for API calls
- ⚠️ **TODO:** CSRF protection

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data:** All pages currently use mock data - need contract integration
2. **Yield Calculation:** Placeholder 8% APY - needs real DeFi integration
3. **Wallet Balance Check:** No pre-flight check for sufficient funds
4. **Transaction Errors:** Basic error handling - needs improvement
5. **Gas Optimization:** Smart contract could be optimized further

### To Be Resolved
- [ ] Integrate actual smart contract calls in frontend
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Implement real-time yield tracking
- [ ] Add transaction history on-chain indexing
- [ ] Optimize gas costs for batch operations
