# Armina User Flow - Finalized

## Overview
This document outlines the finalized user flow and business logic for the Armina arisan DeFi platform based on stakeholder decisions made on 2026-01-19.

---

## Complete User Journey

### 1. Onboarding & Authentication
- User reads onboarding information
- User logs in via Privy (wallet connection)
- User lands on homepage/dashboard

### 2. Pool Discovery & Selection
- User navigates to Pools page
- User browses available pools with different:
  - Monthly contribution amounts
  - Pool sizes (number of participants)
  - Risk levels
  - APY rates from AI Yield Optimizer
- User clicks on desired pool to view details

### 3. Joining a Pool

#### Payment Requirements (Q1: A+B, Q2: A, Q3: Hybrid)
**Pool Start Condition:** Full-based start
- Default pool: 10 participants
- Available pool sizes: 5, 10, 15, or 20 participants (user selects at pool creation)
- Pool only starts when all slots are filled
- Users can join anytime before pool is full

**Payment at Join Time:**
When user clicks "Join Pool", they must pay:
1. **Collateral:** Equal to full pot size (Number of Participants × Monthly Contribution)
   - Example 10-person pool: If monthly = 500K IDRX, collateral = 10 × 500K = 5,000K IDRX
   - Example 20-person pool: If monthly = 500K IDRX, collateral = 20 × 500K = 10,000K IDRX
2. **First Month Contribution:** 100% of monthly amount
   - Example: 500K IDRX

**Total Payment at Join (10-person pool):** 5,500K IDRX (5,000K collateral + 500K first payment)

#### Waiting Period
- User waits for pool to fill up (9 other participants)
- During wait time:
  - Collateral is already deposited in AI Yield Optimizer earning APY
  - User can view pool fill status
  - User CANNOT withdraw (committed)

### 4. Pool Start & Monthly Cycle

#### Pool Activation
- Once 10th user joins and pays, pool officially starts
- Drawing schedule begins (10th of each month, or custom date)

#### Monthly Payment Schedule (Q3: Hybrid - Wallet payments, collateral as security)
**Months 2-N:** Monthly wallet-based payment system
- On the 10th of each month, system attempts to deduct monthly contribution from user's **connected wallet**
- **If wallet has sufficient balance:** Payment processed automatically ✅
- **If wallet has insufficient balance:** User is marked as defaulted, collateral is used to cover payment + penalties apply ⚠️
- **Collateral remains UNTOUCHED if user pays on time from wallet**

**Payment Flow Example (Perfect Attendance - 10 person pool):**
- Month 1: 500K paid at join (from wallet)
- Month 2: 500K auto-deducted from wallet
- Month 3: 500K auto-deducted from wallet
- ...
- Month 10: 500K auto-deducted from wallet
- **Collateral Status:** 5,000K IDRX remains intact throughout! ✅

**Payment Flow Example (Missed 3 Payments - Months 6, 8, 9):**
- Months 1-5: Paid 2,500K from wallet ✅
- Month 6: Wallet insufficient → 500K deducted from collateral + 50K penalty
- Month 7: Paid 500K from wallet ✅
- Month 8: Wallet insufficient → 500K deducted from collateral + 50K penalty
- Month 9: Wallet insufficient → 500K deducted from collateral + 50K penalty
- Month 10: Paid 500K from wallet ✅
- **Collateral Status:** 5,000K - 1,500K (missed payments) - 150K (penalties) = 3,350K remaining

### 5. Monthly Drawing & Winning

#### Drawing Mechanism
- Each month on the 10th (after payments processed)
- Random selection from participants who haven't won yet
- Winner is announced immediately

#### Winner Payout (Q4: B - Pot + Pot Yield only)
**Winner Receives:**
1. **Full Pot:** Sum of all 10 monthly contributions (e.g., 10 × 500K = 5M IDRX)
2. **Pot Yield:** APY earned on the pot amount only
   - Example: If pot earned 42.5K IDRX yield → Winner gets this too

**Winner Does NOT Receive:**
- Their own collateral yield (they keep this separately)
- Other participants' collateral yield (everyone keeps their own)

**Winner's Remaining Obligations:**
- Winner still must pay monthly contributions for remaining months (auto-deducted from collateral)
- Winner's collateral continues earning yield

### 6. Yield Distribution During Pool (Q4: B clarification)

#### Collateral Yield
- **Each participant's collateral earns yield independently**
- Yield is tracked per user
- Example: User deposits 5,000K collateral
  - At 8% APY over 10 months
  - User earns ~333K IDRX yield on their collateral (8% × 5M × 10/12)
  - This yield belongs to that user only

#### Pot Yield
- Monthly contributions pool together (the "pot")
- Pot is also deposited in AI Yield Optimizer
- Pot earns yield collectively
- **Only the month's winner receives pot yield**
- Next month, new pot accumulates with new yield for next winner

### 7. End of Pool (10 Months Complete)

#### Final Settlement (Q5: A - Everyone gets own collateral + yield)

**For Each Participant:**
```
Final Payout = Original Collateral + Collateral Yield - (Missed Payments × Monthly Amount) - Penalties
```

**Note:** Collateral is ONLY deducted if user fails to pay from wallet. Perfect attendance = full collateral returned!

---

**Example 1: Perfect Attendance (Paid All from Wallet) - No Winning**

**Payments Made:**
- Total paid from wallet: 10 × 500K = 5,000K IDRX ✅
- Collateral deductions: 0 (never needed)

**Final Settlement:**
- Original Collateral: 5,000K IDRX
- Collateral Yield: 333K IDRX (8% APY × 5M × 10/12)
- Missed Payments Deducted: 0
- Penalties: 0

**Final Payout:** 5,000K + 333K - 0 - 0 = **5,333K IDRX** ✅

**Total Money Cycle:**
- Spent: 5,000K (wallet payments) + 5,000K (collateral deposited) = 10,000K
- Received: 5,333K (collateral + yield returned)
- **Net Profit:** 333K IDRX (pure yield on collateral)

---

**Example 2: Perfect Attendance + Won Month 5**

**Payments Made:**
- Total paid from wallet: 10 × 500K = 5,000K IDRX ✅
- Collateral deductions: 0

**Prize Received (Month 5):**
- Pot: 5,000K IDRX
- Pot Yield: ~167K IDRX

**Final Settlement:**
- Original Collateral: 5,000K IDRX
- Collateral Yield: 333K IDRX
- Missed Payments Deducted: 0
- Penalties: 0

**Final Payout:** 5,000K + 333K = **5,333K IDRX**

**Total Received:**
- Prize (Month 5): 5,167K IDRX
- Final settlement: 5,333K IDRX
- **Grand Total: 10,500K IDRX** 🎉

**Total Money Cycle:**
- Spent: 5,000K (wallet) + 5,000K (collateral) = 10,000K
- Received: 10,500K
- **Net Profit:** 500K IDRX (pot yield + collateral yield - all contributions)

---

**Example 3: Missed 5 Payments (Months 6-10) - No Winning**

**Payments Made:**
- Paid from wallet (Months 1-5): 2,500K IDRX ✅
- Paid from collateral (Months 6-10): 2,500K IDRX ⚠️
- Penalties: 5 × 50K = 250K IDRX

**Final Settlement:**
- Original Collateral: 5,000K IDRX
- Collateral Yield: 333K IDRX
- Missed Payments Deducted: 2,500K
- Penalties: 250K

**Final Payout:** 5,000K + 333K - 2,500K - 250K = **2,583K IDRX**

**Total Money Cycle:**
- Spent: 2,500K (wallet) + 5,000K (collateral deposited) = 7,500K
- Received: 2,583K (collateral return)
- Payments covered by collateral: 2,500K
- **Effective Net:** -2,417K IDRX loss (penalties ate into yield)

---

**Example 4: Won Month 1 and Kabur (Paid Nothing After) - ANTI-KABUR TEST**

**Payments Made:**
- Month 1: 500K (paid at join) ✅
- Months 2-10: 0 (all missed) → 4,500K deducted from collateral + 450K penalties

**Prize Received (Month 1):**
- Pot: 5,000K IDRX
- Pot Yield: ~35K IDRX
- **Total Prize: 5,035K IDRX**

**Final Settlement:**
- Original Collateral: 5,000K IDRX
- Collateral Yield: 333K IDRX
- Missed Payments Deducted: 4,500K (9 months × 500K)
- Penalties: 450K (9 × 50K)

**Final Payout:** 5,000K + 333K - 4,500K - 450K = **383K IDRX**

**Total Money Cycle:**
- Spent: 500K (month 1) + 5,000K (collateral) = 5,500K
- Received: 5,035K (prize) + 383K (collateral return) = 5,418K
- **Net Result: -82K IDRX (RUGI!)** ✅ **Anti-kabur mechanism works!**

### 8. Post-Pool

#### Successful Completion
- User receives final settlement
- User can join new pools
- User's history/reputation score updated (future feature)

#### Default/Debt
- If final settlement is negative, user must pay outstanding debt
- User cannot join new pools until debt cleared
- Debt collection mechanism (TBD - legal/smart contract enforcement)

## Key Business Rules Summary

| Rule | Decision | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Pool Sizes** | Fixed + Flexible (Q1: A+B) | Default 10 participants; options for 5, 10, 15, 20 person pools |
| **Pool Start** | Full-based | Requires all slots filled before starting |
| **Join Payment** | Upfront | Collateral (= pot size) + first month contribution |
| **Collateral Amount** | Pot Size (Q2: A) | Participants × Monthly Amount (anti-kabur: 10 person = 10×, 20 person = 20×) |
| **Monthly Payments** | Wallet-based (Q3: Hybrid) | Auto-deduct from wallet; collateral only used if wallet insufficient |
| **Missed Payment Handling** | Collateral backup | Deduct from collateral + 10% penalty per missed payment |
| **Winner Payout** | Pot + Pot Yield (Q4: B) | Winner gets pot and pot's yield only, not others' collateral yield |
| **Collateral Yield** | Individual (Q4: B) | Each participant keeps their own collateral yield |
| **Final Settlement** | Full Return - Deductions (Q3) | Collateral + yield - missed payments - penalties |
| **Anti-Kabur Mechanism** | ✅ Proven | Winner who stops paying ends up with net loss (see Example 4) |

---

## Implementation Notes

### ✅ Finalized Mechanism

The collateral and payment system has been finalized with the following approach:

**Collateral Strategy:**
- Collateral = Full pot size (Number of Participants × Monthly Contribution)
- Monthly payments from wallet (auto-deduct)
- Collateral only touched for missed payments
- Full collateral + yield returned if perfect attendance

**Anti-Kabur Verification:**
- Winner who stops paying after winning Month 1 experiences net loss of 82K IDRX
- Mechanism successfully prevents fraud while maintaining accessibility
- See Example 4 above for detailed calculation

### Smart Contract Functions Needed

```solidity
// Core pool management
function createPool(uint256 monthlyAmount, uint8 participants) external;
function joinPool(uint256 poolId) external payable; // Must pay collateral + first contribution
function startPool(uint256 poolId) external; // Triggered when full

// Payment processing
function processMonthlyPayments(uint256 poolId) external; // Auto-deduct from wallets
function applyPenalty(uint256 poolId, address participant) external;

// Drawing & distribution
function conductDrawing(uint256 poolId) external returns (address winner);
function distributePot(uint256 poolId, address winner) external;

// Yield management
function depositToOptimizer(uint256 amount) external;
function trackYield(address user) external view returns (uint256);
function claimYield(uint256 poolId) external; // At pool end

// Settlement
function finalSettlement(uint256 poolId) external;
function calculateFinalPayout(uint256 poolId, address participant) external view returns (int256);
```

#### 3. UI/UX Updates Required

**Pool Join Page:**
- Clear breakdown showing:
  - Pool size: 10 participants
  - Monthly contribution: 500K IDRX
  - Collateral required (pot size): 5,000K IDRX
  - First month payment: 500K IDRX
  - **Total due now: 5,500K IDRX**
  - Monthly wallet balance needed: 500K IDRX (for auto-deduct)
  - Ensure wallet has sufficient IDRX balance

**Dashboard:**
- Show collateral balance and yield separately (never touched if paying on time)
- Show pot contributions tracking (from wallet)
- Show payment history: wallet auto-deduct vs collateral deduction
- Show penalty tracker (10% per missed payment)
- Show projected final payout with scenarios (perfect vs current attendance)

**AI Yield Optimizer Page:**
- Already updated with navy/white theme ✓
- Add user-specific yield tracking (collateral vs pot)

#### 4. Database Schema Updates

```typescript
interface Pool {
  id: string;
  monthlyAmount: number; // in cents (IDRX)
  poolSize: number; // 5, 10, 15, or 20 participants
  collateralRequired: number; // poolSize × monthlyAmount
  currentParticipants: number;
  status: 'open' | 'full' | 'active' | 'completed';
  drawingDate: number; // day of month (10)
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  winners: Address[]; // chronological winners
  currentMonth: number; // 1-N
}

interface Participant {
  userId: string;
  poolId: string;
  collateralDeposited: number; // Full pot size
  collateralYieldEarned: number; // Tracked separately
  collateralUsedForPayments: number; // Amount deducted for missed payments
  paymentHistory: Payment[];
  missedPayments: number; // Count of missed payments
  totalPenalties: number; // 10% × missed × monthlyAmount
  hasWon: boolean;
  wonAtMonth: number | null;
  potReceived: number | null;
  potYieldReceived: number | null;
  finalPayout: number | null;
}

interface Payment {
  month: number;
  amount: number;
  status: 'paid_wallet' | 'paid_collateral' | 'missed';
  timestamp: Date;
  source: 'wallet' | 'collateral'; // Wallet = good, Collateral = missed payment
  penaltyApplied: number; // 0 if paid from wallet, 10% if from collateral
}
```

## ✅ Resolved Questions

All major stakeholder questions have been answered:

1. ✅ **Collateral Mechanism:** Wallet-based payments with collateral backup (Q3: Hybrid)
2. ✅ **Penalty Rate:** 10% per missed payment
3. ✅ **Pool Sizes:** Flexible options (5, 10, 15, 20 participants) - Q1: A+B
4. ✅ **Collateral Amount:** Equal to pot size (poolSize × monthlyAmount) - Q2: A
5. ✅ **Final Settlement:** Collateral + yield - missed payments - penalties - Q3
6. ✅ **Anti-Kabur:** Verified working (see Example 4: -82K net loss)

---

## Remaining Open Questions

1. **Early Exit:** Can users exit pool before completion? If yes, what penalties?
2. **Winner Selection:** Pure random (Chainlink VRF), or weighted by payment history/reputation?
3. **Platform Fee:** What % fee from pot yield or collateral yield? (Currently showing 10% performance fee)
4. **Debt Handling:** If collateral depleted + user still owes, how to collect legally?
5. **Grace Period:** Should there be 1-2 day grace period before marking as missed payment?
6. **Partial Payments:** Can user pay partial amount if wallet insufficient, or all-or-nothing?
